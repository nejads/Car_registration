# Carreg
Car registeration back-end in Django framework
-----------------------------------------------
Tihs is the back-end of the CarOne project and it is developed in Python and Django framework.

CarOne (search my github for this )is a project delevoping in Chalmers University of Technology. An Android application which is a part of a larger project in charging of electric and hybrid vehicle model in an “electric highways” automatically. A user/driver can signup and login in the application. The application has forget password and change password function in the my page. The user can log in with facebook/Google account but this feature is inactive for now.

The Application recieves a surrogate key generated by a database which is developed in mySQL. Once a user/driver logged in, this id can be burnt on a NFC tag which later can be installed underneath of an electronic vehicle. Once the vehicle passes through the electronic lane, the id will be retrieved by a tag reader. === Under development: The consumed energy in Kilo/Watt/Hour will be calculated and an electronic bill will be generated for the user.
